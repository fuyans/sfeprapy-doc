Application of `SFEPRAPY`
=========================

Intention
---------

time equivalence probabilistic reliability assessment (TEQPRA or known
as PRA to many) is one of the theoretical fundations to structural fire
resistance (B3) recommendations in many design guidences in the UK
(e.g. Approved Document B [1] and BS 9999 [2]). The fire resistance
requirements that are given in the guidence are based on results of a
generallised compartment and associated (also generallised) fire model
parameters. This generalisation resulted in a simple-to-use fire
resistance table which indicates a ‘required fire resistance rating’ for
given building height and occupancy characteristics. Inavoidably, the
base model that used for the study [3] that underpins the
recommendations in the guidence imposes certain design limitations
(i.e. building height, compartment size etc) which are not directly
obvious to end users.

As such, additional fire engineering assessment is necessary for
buildings with higher consequence class (greater than X as defined in
[ref X]).

This note is intended to assist one to identify the value/benefit for
carrying out a TEQPRA assessment for a specific project or building.

Process overview
----------------

The process to determine whether a TEQPRA assessment is
necessary/benefitial brokes into the following three steps:

1. Check if ``additional fire safety engineering provisions`` are
   required for B3 other than following prescriptive guildence? This is
   normally defined in the guidence.

   Section 0.3 in BS 9999:2017 noted the following: > “However, the
   increased design demands on structural integrity, services, fire
   safety systems, means of fire-fighting and evacuation generated by
   buildings in excess of 50 m high might mean that specific evaluation
   of all fire safety provisions is needed using a qualitative design
   review in accordance with BS 7974.”

   PD 7974-6 [pd7974-6]

2. Is time equivalence hand calculation method adequate to address the
   above recommendation? A hand calculation method is available in PD
   6688-1-2 [pd6688] (originated from EC 1991-1-2). Similar to the fire
   resistance table, this hand calculation method is derived based on
   analysis of generallised fire and compartment parameters. Therefore,
   limitations detailed in PD 6688 and the parametric fire model should
   be followed.

3. If hand calculation method is not adequate (i.e. given building is
   outside of the limitations) then a detailed time equivalence
   assessment is necesary.

Considerations
--------------

-  1.1 Building height.

   -  is the building greater than 50 m? BS 9999, ADB and other
      guidances that share similar theoretical basis are not designed
      for high rise buildings over 50 m. These buildings will need to be
      engineered to make sure fire safety is appropriately applied. In
      this instance, PRA TEQ takes care of B3 to ensure appropriate
      level of structural stabi
